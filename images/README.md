# Images

Put images file in their respective category folders.

## Size rules

Aspect icons should be at most 128x128.
Element icons should be at most 256x256.
Ending cards should be 400x580.
Legacy icons should be at most 128x128.
Verb icons should be at most 256x256.

Avoid 1, 2, 4K resolutions, as loading too many of these can make the game startup time way, way longer, or even crash the game (a handful of 2K pictures are enough to do that).
